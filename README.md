# PictoImage
For importing images into pict.chat (PictoChat Online)

Take any image and import it into pictochat online!

## Prerequisite

You need to install a few libraries for this to work:
```
pip install pyautogui pillow keyboard
```
Then make sure anything past this point is **run in administrator** to gain
access to mouse input and keyboard.

## Instructions
Once the script starts, you have 3 seconds to position your cursor in the drawing
section of pictochat. This process will take awhile depending on the complexity of
the image. 

If you don't, the cursor will click aimlessly until you stop the program or press the
"f" key.
